# COMP 6630 - Final Project Documentation

## Datasets

We have used [ag_news](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ag_news) data from huggingface. Therefore, you do not need to download or use your own data set. 

## Install Datasets

`!pip3 install datasets`

This is the first line in each of the implementations. You need to run this if you do not have the datasets library installed on your local machine.

## Run Models

You can choose to `Run All` if you would like to run everything at once (sequentially). Or you could choose to `Run Each Cell` to run each cell and observe the output of each cell before proceeding. One caveat is, you must execute cells sequentially if you are choosing to run them each individually.
